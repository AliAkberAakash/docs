By default, users authenticate to [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud) using their email address and a password. These credentials are stored in your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} organization and are not synchronized with an identity provider (IdP). With Cloud Organization Single Sign-On (Preview), users can authenticate to {{ site.data.products.db }} using any SSO provider that is configured for their organization. After enabling and verifying Cloud Organization SSO, you can disable email and password authentication for your {{ site.data.products.db }} organization.

By default, GitHub, Google, and Microsoft are supported as SSO authentication methods, and you can configure a custom authentication method using SAML or OIDC. Users are identified by their email address. When multiple SSO authentication methods are enabled, users can choose among them.
