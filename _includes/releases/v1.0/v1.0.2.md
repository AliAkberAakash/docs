<h3 id="beta-20160407-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-incompatible Changes</h3>

* Any databases using the [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) type will need to be deleted and
  created from scratch. Columns of this type were encoded incorrectly
  by `beta-20160330`.
  [#5820](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5820)
* [`SELECT`](../v1.0/select.html) statements must now specify one or more columns or
  expressions. Previously, statements such as `SELECT FROM t` were
  allowed but the results would confuse many clients.
  [#5859](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5859)
* It is now an error to insert a value that is too large into a column
  with a type of limited length such as [`VARCHAR(n)`](../v1.0/string.html).
  [#5750](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5750)

<h3 id="beta-20160407-compatibility">Compatibility</h3>

* Added support for the "flush" message in the PostgreSQL network
  protocol, which improves compatibility with the [node.js driver](../v1.0/install-client-drivers.html).
  [#5740](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5740)
* Fixed a panic when handling certain queries sent by the PHP PDO
  library. [#5783](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5783)
* Improved parsing of timestamps for compatibility with the Go
  `lib/pq` client library.
  [#5877](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5877)

<h3 id="beta-20160407-new-features">New Features</h3>

* Index hints: `SELECT FROM tbl@idx` or `SELECT FROM
  tbl@{FORCE_INDEX=idx}` instructs the query planner to use the given
  index. [#5785](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5785)
  and [#5806](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5806)
* The `cockroach` command-line client now accepts environment
  variables as default values for many command-line flags. See
  `--help` for details.
  [#5430](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5430)
* Added SQL `version()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html).
  [#5763](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5763)
* Added compiler and platform information to `cockroach version`
  output. [#5766](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5766)
* Debugging tools show fractional seconds in timestamps.
  [#5736](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5736)
* In secure mode, plain HTTP requests to the [`http-port`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) used by the
  admin UI are now redirected to HTTPS.
  [#5746](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5746)
* Links to debugging pages are available on the HTTP port at
  `/debug/`.
  [#5795](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5795)
* The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command now echos the new configuration.
  [#5829](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5829)

<h3 id="beta-20160407-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

* Improved flow control for raft snapshots, fixing an issue that could
  lead to nodes running out of memory.
  [#5721](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5721)
* Fixed a deadlock scenario in which two conflicting transactions
  would both be unable to make progress.
  [#5710](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5710)
* Fixed a panic while executing certain [`DELETE`](../v1.0/delete.html) statements.
  [#5840](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5840)

<h3 id="beta-20160407-internal-changes">Internal Changes</h3>

* Clock offsets are now measured continuously.
  [#5512](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5512)
* Improved caching to avoid redundant range descriptor lookups.
  [#5627](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5627)

<h3 id="beta-20160414-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-incompatible Changes</h3>

* Any databases using the [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) type will need to be deleted and created from scratch. Columns of this type were encoded incorrectly in older beta releases. (Again! We apologize for the inconvenience.) [#5994](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5994)
* The [SQL function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) `transaction_timestamp_unique` has been removed in favor of the new `cluster_logical_timestamp` function described below.

<h3 id="beta-20160414-new-features">New Features</h3>

* [`ALTER TABLE`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) supports several new operations: `ADD COLUMN` with a
  default value
  ([#5759](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5759)),
  `ALTER COLUMN SET DEFAULT`, `ALTER COLUMN DROP DEFAULT`, and `ALTER
  COLUMN DROP NOT NULL`
  ([#5947](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5947))
* The `TIMESTAMPTZ` type is now accepted as an alias for [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html)
  for compatibility with PostgreSQL; our `TIMESTAMP` type already
  supports time zones in the same way as PostgreSQL's `TIMESTAMPTZ`.
  [#5893](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5893)
* The [`STRING`](../v1.0/string.html) type now accepts a length parameter (e.g.,
  `STRING(50)`), similar to `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`.
  [#5918](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5918)
* The `LIMIT` clause now accepts placeholders.
  [#5977](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5977)
* The `RETURNING` clause of [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html), [`DELETE`](../v1.0/delete.html), and [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html)
  statements now accepts placeholders.
  [#5934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5934)
* When sending queries to the `cockroach sql` tool via `stdin`, a
  terminating semicolon is not required and instructions for
  interactive mode are no longer printed (similar to the existing
  behavior of `-e`).
  [#5988](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5988)
* The `experimental_uuid_v4()` [SQL function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) has been renamed to
  `uuid_v4()`. The old name remains as a deprecated alias.
  [#5886](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5886)

<h3 id="beta-20160414-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

* Reduced the number of files created in the data directory, and fixed
  issues in which the process could run out of file descriptors.
  [#5888](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5888)
* Introduced a special fast path for transactions that are contained
  entirely within one range. [#5966](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5966)
* Reduced the number of unnecessary network round trips by ensuring
  that the range lease holder and the raft leader coincide.
  [#5973](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5973)

<h3 id="beta-20160414-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

* The gossip system no longer recommends redundant forwarding
  addresses, which could prevent the cluster from fully connecting.
  [#5901](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5901)
* Timestamps are now correctly reported in the network protocol as
  having time zone offsets.
  [#5909](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5909)
* Buffered data is now flushed to the network immediately on error.
  [#5909](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5909)
* Timeseries data no longer diverges across replicas.
  [#5905](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5905)

<h3 id="beta-20160414-internal-changes">Internal Changes</h3>

* [SQL functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) related to the current time (`now`,
  `current_timestamp`, `statement_timestamp`, `statement_timestamp`)
  now use the clock of the node that executed them instead of a
  timestamp derived from the internal hybrid logical clock. This means
  that these functions are less likely to produce duplicate values,
  but it is more likely for one transaction to see a timestamp that is
  less than a timestamp already seen in another transaction.
  Applications that require a globally monotonic timestamp-like value
  can use the new function `cluster_logical_timestamp` instead.
  [#5805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5805)
* New HTTP endpoint `/debug/metrics` exposes internal metric data in
  JSON format.
  [#5894](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5894)
* [Logs](../v1.0/debug-and-error-logs.html) are no longer written to `stderr` by default, only to the
  `logs` subdirectory of the data directory.
  [#5979](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5979)

<h3 id="beta-20160421-upgrade-procedure">Upgrade Procedure</h3>

* This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases.
  Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any
  node with this version.

<h3 id="beta-20160421-new-features">New Features</h3>

* [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements may now set columns which are part of the
  primary key.
  [#6043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6043)
* `CHECK` constraints can now be defined when creating tables and will
  be enforced for [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements (but not yet for [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html)
  statements).
  [#6044](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6044)
* The `pow()` and `exp()` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) on `DECIMAL` values no longer lose
  precision.
  [#6170](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6170)
* In the [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell, the special command `!` can now be used
  to execute a system command and display its output. `|` executes a
  system command and runs its output as a SQL statement.
  [#5961](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5961)
* Added `SHOW CREATE TABLE`.
  [#6158](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6158)
* The `RETURNING` clause of [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements can now refer to tables
  by aliases defined with `AS`.
  [#5903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5903)
* The SQL parser now accepts the `CASCADE` and `RESTRICT` keywords in
  the [`DROP INDEX`](../v1.0/drop-index.html), [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](../v1.0/truncate.html), [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../v1.0/alter-table.html), and [`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) statements. These keywords relate to
  features we have not yet implemented, so they do nothing, but this change
  improves compatibility with frameworks that like to send these
  keywords.
  [#5957](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5957)

<h3 id="beta-20160421-admin-ui">Admin UI</h3>

* The time scale used for graphs can now be changed.
  [#6145](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6145)
* Some UI elements now include tooltips with additional explanations.
  [#6006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6006)
* A warning is displayed when the cluster is unreachable.
  [#6042](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6042)
* There are now fewer unnecessary scrollbars.
  [#6018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6018)

<h3 id="beta-20160421-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

* The rebalancer is now better at distributing ranges across the nodes
  in a cluster.
  [#6133](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6133)
* Fixed a major cause of "timestamp in future" errors.
  [#5845](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5845)
* Fixed several potential panics.
  [#6111](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6111)
  [#6143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6143)

<h3 id="beta-20160421-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

* Improved the performance of schema changes while data is being
  modified.
  [#5996](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5996)
* The RPC subsystem is now bypassed for requests to the local node.
  [#6021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6021)
* Information about completed transactions is now cleaned up more
  efficiently.
  [#5882](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5882)
* Fixed a leak of goroutines.
  [#6010](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6010)
* Reduced memory allocations on the critical path.

<h3 id="beta-20160428-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

* Time zone offsets are no longer shown when querying columns of type
  `TIMESTAMP`; the new type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` should be used
  instead. This is more consistent with other databases.
  [#6165](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6165)

<h3 id="beta-20160428-new-features">New Features</h3>

* `INTERVAL` values accept two new formats: ISO8601 (`P2H30M`) and the
  PostgreSQL format (`2 hours 30 minutes`) in addition to the existing
  Go style (`2h30m`).
  [#6216](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6216)
* Tuples can now be compared in SQL expressions.
  [#6217](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6217)
* The server now implements the `systemd` `NOTIFY_SOCKET` protocol.
  [#6268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6268)
* The new flag `cockroach start --background` can be used to start a
  server in the background. This is better than appending `&` because
  the process doesn't return until it is ready to receive traffic.
  [#6268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6268)

<h3 id="beta-20160428-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

* The SQL shell can once again be suspended with `ctrl-z`.
  [#6171](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6171)
* Fixed an error in the SQL shell when the history file contains empty
  lines. [#6192](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6192)
* The `--store` and `--key-size` command-line flags are no longer
  marked as required.
  [#6229](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6229)
* The command line interface is better about printing errors to
  `stderr`, not just the log file.
  [#6258](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6258)
* The `INFO` log file is now created in the correct default location
  (`cockroach-data/logs`) instead of `$TMPDIR`.
  [#6265](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6265)
* Fixed errors that could be introduced by updating tables while a
  schema change is in progress.
  [#6160](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6160)

  there is a conflicting row for the primary key.
  [#6456](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6456)
* The SQL type system has been overhauled, reducing the number of
  explicit casts required.
  [RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20160203_typing.md)
* Tuples are now considered for index selection, so `SELECT * FROM t

  [#6414](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6414)
* Ranges that have grown above the target size are now split before
  being rebalanced, reducing memory usage.
  [#6447](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6447)
* Reduced rapid memory growth during partitions.
  [#6448](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6448)

  [#6336](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6336)
* Scanning over records that have only one MVCC version is faster.
  [#6351](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6351)
* The command queue now uses coarse-grained spans until a conflict has
  occurred.
  [#6412](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6412)
* When a replica is rebalanced from one node to another, the old node
  no longer triggers unnecessary Raft elections.
  [#6423](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6423)

<h3 id="beta-20160505-production">Production</h3>

  bug in which requests could be retried repeatedly on the wrong node.
  [#6425](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6425)
* Fixed a bug with some queries using aggregate functions like `MIN()`
  and `MAX()`. [#6380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6380)
* Tuple comparisons now work correctly when one tuple contains `NULL`.
  [#6370](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6370)

<h3 id="beta-20160505-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

* Community-supported docs and configuration files for [running CockroachDB inside a single VirtualBox virtual machine](http://uptimedba.github.io/cockroach-vb-single/cockroach-vb-single/home.html). [#263](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/263)

- The new [`EXPLAIN (TYPES)`](../v1.0/explain.html) subcommand prints information about the types of expressions in a statement. [#6482](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6482)
- Added the aggregate functions [`BOOL_AND()`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) and [`BOOL_OR()`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html). [#6535](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6535)
- The aggregate functions [`SUM(INT)`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) and [`AVG(INT)`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now return `DECIMAL` instead of `INT` and `FLOAT` respectively. [#6532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6532)
- The new command-line flag [`--raft-tick-interval`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) allows the raft heartbeat frequency to be changed in high-latency deployments. [#6615](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6615)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values can now be cast to type `STRING`. [#6605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6605)
- The [`CREATE DATABASE`](../v1.0/create-database.html) statement now accepts an `ENCODING` option for compatibility with PostgreSQL, although `UTF8` is the only supported encoding. [#6614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6614)

<h3 id="beta-20160512-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug when a single [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statement inserts multiple values for the same primary key. [#6564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6564)
- Fixed an inconsistency that could occur when a transaction in [`SNAPSHOT` isolation](../v1.0/transactions.html#isolation-levels) used the internal `DeleteRange` operation. [#6548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6548)
- Fixed an integer underflow that could result in log messages like `transport: http2Server received 4294965918-bytes`. [#6567](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6567)
- Long-running transactions are no longer allowed to exceed their table descriptor lease. [#6418](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6418)
- Subtracting an `INTERVAL` from a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` returns a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` instead of one without a time zone. [#6540](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6540)
- Improved type checking of comparisons involving tuples. [#6517](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6517)

- [Data type](../v1.0/data-types.html) docs now provide details about storage size.
- Although it's not possible to access CockroachDB's key-value store directly, the [FAQ](../v1.0/frequently-asked-questions.html#can-i-use-cockroachdb-as-a-key-value-store) now suggests a SQL alternative.
- [Replication recommendations](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html#node-replica-recommendations) now address cross-datacenter scenarios.

<h3 id="beta-20160519-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values are now truncated to microsecond resolution when sent over the network for compatibility with the PostgreSQL protocol. The `format_timestamp_ns(ts)` or `extract(nanosecond from ts)` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) can be used to access the full nanosecond precision of a timestamp. The `now()`, `current_timestamp()`, and `statement_timestamp()` functions are truncated to microsecond resolution to avoid confusion when timestamp values are used in unique indexes; the new `current_timestamp_ns()` function can be used to get a non-truncated timestamp. [#6604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6604)

<h3 id="beta-20160519-new-features">New Features</h3>

- `DO NOTHING` is now supported in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements. [#6633](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6633)

- [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints now work correctly when columns have been dropped. [#6730](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6730)
- Tuples and the `DEFAULT` keyword now work in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements. [#6636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6636)
- Errors are now reported with standard PostgreSQL error codes in more places. [#6652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6652), [#6554](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6554)
- Fixed a panic while a node is attempting a clean shutdown. [#6677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6677)
- Internal retry logic has been improved so requests are no longer stuck retrying endlessly on the wrong replica. [#6688](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6688)

<h3 id="beta-20160519-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Snapshot generation is now throttled to reduce peak memory consumption.
  [#6632](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6632)
- Improved performance for transactions with low contention. [#6413](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6413)
- Improved performance for `UPSERT` statements (and the equivalent [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements) when the table has no secondary indexes and values are supplied for all columns in the table. [#6673](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6673)

<h3 id="beta-20160519-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- [SQL Grammar](../v1.0/sql-grammar.html) diagrams have been streamlined to reduce unnecessary duplication.

<h3 id="beta-20160526-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Numeric literals containing a decimal point are now treated as type [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) instead of type [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html), unless type inference determines that `FLOAT` should be used. In some cases, an explicit `CAST(x AS FLOAT)` may be needed. [#6752](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6752)
- The custom error codes `CR000` (indicating a transaction needs to be [retried](../v1.0/transactions.html#transaction-retries)) and `CR001` (indicating a transaction is in an invalid state) have been replaced with the PostgreSQL standard error codes `40001` (serialization failure) and `25000` (invalid transaction state), respectively. [#6797](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6797)

<h3 id="beta-20160526-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- [`DROP DATABASE`](../v1.0/drop-database.html) now works correctly with quoted names. [#6851](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6851)
- Gracefully shutting down a node now completes faster. [#6777](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6777)
- [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`](../v1.0/insert.html) no longer crashes the server when no conflicting index is given. [#6795](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6795)
- [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`](../v1.0/insert.html) now requires only the `INSERT` permission instead of both `INSERT` and `UPDATE`. [#6827](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6827)
- Numeric literals in scientific notation are now case-insensitive. [#6864](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6864)
- `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` is now recognized as a synonym for [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html). [#6888](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6888)
- Attempting to access a database that does not exist now returns PostgreSQL error code `3D000` ("invalid catalog name") instead of a generic error. [#6680](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6680)

<h3 id="beta-20160526-internal-changes">Internal Changes</h3>

- Most of the `/_status/` HTTP endpoints now use GRPC internally. [#6702](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6702) [#6788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6788)
- The `cockroach exterminate` command (which did not work) has been removed. [#6780](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6780)
- Garbage collection now retains the first value outside the configured interval, since it was the current value at the start of the interval. [#6778](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6778)

<h3 id="beta-20160526-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Docs on the [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statement are now available. [#308](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/308)

- Floor division is now supported with a new [operator](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#operators), `//`. [#6642](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6642)
- Sub-queries are now allowed in `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, and `RETURNING` expressions. [#6735](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6735)

<h3 id="beta-20160602-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

</div>

<h3 id="beta-20160609-new-features">New Features</h3>

- The [`SERIAL`](../v1.0/serial.html) column type is now supported as an alias for `INT DEFAULT unique_rowid()`. In CockroachDB, this type defaults to a unique 64-bit signed integer that is the combination of the insert timestamp and the ID of the node executing the insert. It therefore differs from similar types in PostgreSQL and MySQL, which auto-increment integers in an approximate sequence. [#7032](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7032)
- For client-side [transaction retries](../v1.0/transactions.html#transaction-retries), reissuing the original `SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` now has the same effect as `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`. This improves compatibility with some client drivers. [#6955](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6955)
- `FAMILY` is now a reserved word in the SQL dialect in preparation for a future feature. [#7069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7069)

<h3 id="beta-20160609-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- The [command-line SQL shell](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) is now able to print non-ASCII characters. [#7045](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7045), [#7048](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7048)
- Commands issued with a timestamp outside the garbage collection window will now always fail. [#6992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6992)
- All aggregate functions now return `NULL` when run on a table with no rows. [#7043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7043)

<h3 id="beta-20160609-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- <a href="http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/" data-proofer-ignore><code>jemalloc</code></a> is now used as the memory allocator for the C++ portions of the server. The build tag `stdmalloc` can be used to switch back to the standard `malloc`. [#7006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7006)
- Raft logs are now garbage collected more aggressively. This should generally make snapshots smaller, reducing memory pressure, but sometimes it may cause more snapshots to be sent. [#7040](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7040)
- Reduced allocations in [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) and [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements involving secondary indexes. [#7011](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7011)
- Improved performance of conditional puts with no existing value. [#7016](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7016)
- Improved performance of small transactions. [#7015](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7015)

<h3 id="beta-20160609-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- The [Build an App](../v1.0/build-a-rust-app-with-cockroachdb.html) tutorial now demonstrates connecting to CockroachDB from the [Rust Postgres driver](../v1.0/install-client-drivers.html).
- Docs on the [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html) statement now offer both basic and expanded grammar diagrams. [#347](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/347)
- Docs on [constraints](../v1.0/constraints.html) now include diagrams of all table-level and row-level constraints. [#361](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/361)

- [Aggregate functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) like `SUM()` are no longer allowed in `CHECK` or `DEFAULT` expressions. [#7221](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7221)

<h3 id="beta-20160616-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Improved rate limiting of snapshots during rebalancing, reducing memory usage and improving availability. [#6878](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6878)

<h3 id="beta-20160629-new-features">New Features</h3>

- A prototype implementation of `JOIN` (non-optimized) is now available. [#7202](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7202)
- [Column Families](../v1.0/column-families.html) are a new, more efficient representation of SQL tables. Each column family is a group of columns in a table that are stored as a single underlying key-value pair. New tables created with multi-column families will not be compatible with versions of CockroachDB earlier than `beta-20160629`. However, no migration of existing tables is necessary; the previous format corresponds to a separate column family for each column in the table. [#7466](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7466), [#7408](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7408), [RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20151214_sql_column_families.md)
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) can now be used with `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER` statements. [#7269](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7269)
- The [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now prints tab-separated values instead of ASCII-art tables when `stdout` is not a TTY (unless `--pretty` is used). [#7268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7268)
- In interactive mode, the [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now prints the number of rows at the end of a result set. [#7266](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7266)
- Prepared statements can now be deallocated with the `DEALLOCATE` command. [#7367](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7367)
- Added support for interval types in placeholders. [#7382](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7382)
- Added support for hexadecimal-encoded [`STRING`](../v1.0/string.html) literals. [#7138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7138)

<h3 id="beta-20160629-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- The load balancing system now operates at a steadier pace, reducing spikes in memory usage and reaching equilibrium more quickly. [#7147](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7147)
- The block cache is now shared across stores on the same node. [#7496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7496)
- Initial replication in a new cluster is now significantly faster. [#7355](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7355)
- The Raft log is now more aggressively truncated. [#7125](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7125)
- The RocksDB block-size is now set to a more reasonable value. [#7276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7276)
- A new reservation system now ensures that there is enough free space and not too many existing reservations before trying to replicate a range to a new store. This stops the thundering herd that can occur when adding a new node to a cluster. [#7147](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7147)
- Miscellaneous performance improvements in the underlying data distribution and replication protocol.

<h3 id="beta-20160629-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause a server crash on startup. [#7447](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7447)
- Improved the handling of `NULL` values in arithmetic and comparison operations. [#7341](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7341)
- Fixed a crash when session arguments could not be parsed. [#7231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7231)
- Improved error messages for parts of the PostgreSQL protocol we do not support. [#7233](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7233)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now be used in prepared statements. [#7251](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7251)
- Raft messages are no longer canceled due to unrelated errors. [#7252](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7252)
- [Constraint](../v1.0/constraints.html) names that are specified at the column level are now preserved. [#7271](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7271)
- When [`COMMIT`](../v1.0/commit-transaction.html) returns an error, the transaction is considered closed and a separate `ROLLBACK` is no longer necessary. [#7282](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7282)
- The [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now escapes strings in a format that the SQL parser will accept. [#7294](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7294)
- Fixed issues when two snapshots were being sent simultaneously. [#7299](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7299)
- When a column is [renamed](../v1.0/rename-column.html), any `CHECK` constraints referring to that column are now updated. [#7311](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7311)
- When piping commands into the [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html), the last line was previously ignored. Now it will be executed if it ends with a semicolon, or report an error if it is non-empty but not a complete statement. [#7328](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7328)
- When [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) fails to drain a node, it is now forced to quit. [#7483](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7483)
- Fixed a case in which a removed replica could prevent the rebalance queue from making progress. [#7507](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7507)
- Fixed a bug that slowed down population of new replicas. [#7252](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7252)

<h3 id="beta-20160714-upgrade-notes">Upgrade Notes</h3>

- This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases. Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any node with this version.
- After running this release, it is impossible to downgrade to any release older than [`beta-20160629`](beta-20160629.html).
- This release uses more open file descriptors than older releases. It is recommended to set the process's file descriptor limit to at least 10000. See [Recommended Production Settings](../v1.0/recommended-production-settings.html) for more details.

<h3 id="beta-20160714-new-features">New Features</h3>

- The `cockroach dump` command can now be used to back up the contents of a table. The output of `dump` is a series of SQL statements that can be used to recreate the table. [#7511](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7511)
- The `ILIKE` [operator](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) for case-insensitive matching is now supported. [#7635](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7635)
- Four new [operators](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) for regular expression matches are now supported: `~` (regex match), `!~` (negated regex match), `~*` (case-insensitive regex match), `!~*` (negated case-insensitive regex matcH). [#7686](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7686)
- The new `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` statement can be used to show the constraints on a table. [#7584](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7584)
- `FOREIGN KEY` constraints can now have names. [#7627](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7627)
- The [`--http-addr`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) flag can be used to control the network interface used for the web UI. [#7475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7475)
- [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) can now be used to create [column families](../v1.0/column-families.html). [#7711](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7711)
- CockroachDB can now be built on FreeBSD. See this [blog post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/critters-in-a-jar-running-cockroachdb-in-a-freebsd-jail/) for details. [#7545](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7545)
- The `uidebug` `Makefile` target, used for development of the web UI, has been replaced with the environment variable `COCKROACH_DEBUG_UI=1`. [#7601](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7601)

<h3 id="beta-20160714-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- [Column families](../v1.0/column-families.html) are now used by default, improving performance of all tables created in this release and beyond. [#7623](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7623)
- Removed replicas are now garbage collected more quickly. [#7533](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7533)
- RocksDB is now configured to use more, smaller files. This improves performance by reducing the amount of data rewritten during compactions, but increases the number of open file descriptors used by the process. [#7532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7532)
- The server now increases its soft file descriptor limit if it is too low and this is allowed by the hard limit. [#7747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7747)
- The raft log can now be truncated even if a replica is behind, reducing the size of snapshots that must be transmitted over the network (but somewhat increasing the likelihood that a snapshot will be needed instead of replaying the log). [#7438](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7438)
- Raft-related messages are now sent in separate streams for each range. [#7534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7534)
- Raft commands for queries that have been abandoned by the client are no longer retried internally. [#7605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7605)

- Fixed a data race when a transaction is abandoned by the client. [#7738](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7738)
- Fixed a scenario in which intents could not be resolved. [#7744](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7744)
- RocksDB is no longer allowed to use all available file descriptors. [#7747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7747)
- Using `*` as an argument to functions other than `COUNT(*)` no longer causes the server to panic. [#7751](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7751)
- Fixed a deadlock during shutdown. [#7770](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7770)

<h3 id="beta-20160714-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

<h3 id="beta-20160829-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command no longer takes its input directly on the command line. Instead, it accepts a `--file` flag to read from a file, or `--file=-` to read from standard input. [#7953](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7953)

<h3 id="beta-20160829-new-features">New Features</h3>

- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now be used with `JOIN` queries. [#8198](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8198)
- The type `BIT` now works correctly (as a shorthand for `BIT(1)`). The length limit is now enforced. [#8326](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8326)
- The `SHOW` commands now only show tables that the current user has permission to access. [#8070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8070)

This week's release includes many user-visible changes and features that have been in development since our [stability-focused "code yellow"](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cant-run-100-node-cockroachdb-cluster/) started back in August. When we entered "code yellow", all work unrelated to stability was done in a secondary development environment. Since then, we've made great progress, and so have moved many of these new features back into our main development environment.

<h3 id="beta-20161013-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values are now stored with microsecond precision instead of nanoseconds. All nanosecond-related functions have been removed. An existing table `t` with nanosecond timestamps in column `s` can round them to microseconds with `UPDATE t SET s = s + '0s'`. However, note that this could potentially cause uniqueness problems if the timestamp is a primary key. [#8864](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8864)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values (without `TIME ZONE`) are now parsed in UTC, not in the session time zone. [#9444](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9444)
- The deprecated `--http-addr` flag has been removed. When [starting a node](../v1.0/start-a-node.html), use the `--http-host` flag instead to specify the address to listen on for Admin UI HTTP requests. [#9725](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9725)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Tables can now be [interleaved](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) into other tables. Interleaving tables improves query performance by optimizing the key-value structure of closely related tables, attempting to keep data on the same key-value range if it’s likely to be read and written together. [#7985](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7985)
- The [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v1.0/create-table-as.html) statement can now be used to create a table based on the results of a `SELECT` statement. [#8802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8802), [#9278](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9278)
- The [`ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT AT`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) command can now be used to force a range split at a specified key. [#8938](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8938)
- Added new `information_schema` metatables as well as initial support for the `pg_catalog` database. This work is part of our ongoing effort to provide standard database introspection required by popular ORMs. [#8433](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8433), [#8498](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8498), [#9565](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9565), [#9114](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9114), [#9104](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9104)
- [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints can now be added with the [`ALTER TABLE ADD CHECK`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) and `ALTER TABLE VALIDATE` statements. [#9127](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9127) [#9152](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9152)
- The [`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) statement can now drop [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) and [`FOREIGN KEY`](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) constraints. [#8747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8747)
- The [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](../v1.0/show-constraints.html) statement now requires the user to have privileges for the requested table. [#8658](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8658)
- The [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) statement now works correctly for `VALUES` statements containing subqueries. [#8970](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8970)
- The [`TRUNCATE`](../v1.0/truncate.html) statement now implements the `CASCADE` modifier. [#9240](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9240)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values that include a time zone can now omit the minutes field of the time zone offset, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#8666](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8666)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html) values can now be input in a colon-delimited format (H:M or H:M_S), for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#8603](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8603)
- The `INT8` type is now supported as an alias for [`INT`](../v1.0/int.html). [#8858](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8858)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html), [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html), [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v1.0/timestamp.html), and [`DATE`](../v1.0/date.html) values can now be casted to/from more types. [#9731](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9731)
- The window functions `row_number()`, `rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()`, `ntile()`, `lead()`, `lag()`, `first_value()`, `last_value()`, `nth_value()` are now supported. [#8928](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8928), [#9321](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9321), [#9335](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9335)
- The `exp()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) returns an error if its argument is greater than 1024 instead of performing excessively expensive computation. [#8822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8822)
- The `round()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now breaks ties by rounding to the nearest even value (also known as bankers' rounding). It is now faster, and returns an error when given an excessively large number of digits. [#8822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8822)
- The `concat_agg` [aggregate function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) is now supported. [#9690](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9690)
- New [date/time functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html), `extract_duration()`, `experimental_strptime()` and `experimental_strftime()`, are now supported. [#9734](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9734), [#9762](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9762)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-protocol-changes">Protocol Changes</h3>

- The `COPY` protocol is now supported on the server side with the `COPY FROM` statement. The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command-line tool does not yet recognize this command but it can be used with other client interfaces. [#8756](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8756)
- [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values are now encoded correctly for drivers that use the binary format. [#8319](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8319)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html), [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) and [`DATE`](../v1.0/date.html) values can now use the binary protocol format for clients that support it. [#8590](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8590), [#8762](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8762)
- [`NULL` values](../v1.0/null-handling.html) are now sent with the correct type OID, which is required by some PostgreSQL drivers. [#9331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9331)
- The [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html) and [`CREATE DATABASE`](../v1.0/create-database.html) statements now return the standard PostgreSQL error code when the table or database already exists. [#9235](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9235)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-command-line-interface-changes">Command-line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html#standard-output) command now prints additional fields to `stdout`: `clusterID`, `nodeID`, and `status`, which indicates whether the node started a new cluster, joined an existing cluster for the first time, or rejoined an existing cluster. [#9066](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9066)
- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command now terminates with a non-zero exit status if it was interrupted with **Ctrl+C** or a signal. [#9051](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9051)
- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command now supports the `--disable-replication` flag, which sets the desired replication factor to 1. [#9253](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9253)
- The [`cockroach gen example-data`](../v1.0/generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) command can now be used to generate SQL for example databases. [#9231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9231), [#9475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9475)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now presents a new prompt when **Ctrl+C** is pressed after the user starts entering a statement. [#9704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9704)
- When using **Ctrl+R** in the [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell to recall a previous statement from the shell history, the search is now case-insensitive. [#9704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9704)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now reports unterminated final statements as errors instead of ignoring them. [#8838](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8838)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now reports when the connection to the server is lost and a new connection is opened. [#9613](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9613)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now ignores lines that contain only whitespace (e.g., comments). [#9243](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9243)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now prints expressions in [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) and the shell history such as `E::T` or `E:::T` in the same format entered instead of using the longer `CAST` or `TYPE_ANNOTATE` syntax. [#9739](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9739)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now stops processing statements at the first error encountered when reading from a file (non-interactively). This behavior is customizable with the new [`unset errexit`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-shell-commands) shell command. [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now checks if a statement or query is syntactically valid on the client side before it is sent to the server. This ensures that a typo or mistake during user entry does not inconveniently abort an ongoing transaction previously started interactively. This behavior is customizable with the new [`unset check_syntax`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-shell-commands) shell command. [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now works better with multi-line statements. In particular, users will find it easier to recall and edit previously entered multi-line statements. This behavior is customizable with a new command [`unset normalize_history`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-shell-commands). [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now works correctly under `kubectl` and other environments that hide the size of the terminal. [#9097](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9097)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-ui-changes">UI Changes</h3>

<h3 id="beta-20161027-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Functions that return the current time - including `now()` - now return values of type [`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) instead of `TIMESTAMP`, unless called from a context that expects the latter type. [#9618](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9618)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- [Views](../v1.0/views.html) are now supported. Views are stored queries, represented as virtual tables, that produce a result set when requested. They can be used to hide query complexity, limit access to underlying data, or simplify the process of supporting legacy code.  
- Tables in the `pg_catalog` database can now be accessed with unqualified names if no table of the same name exists in the current database. [#9927](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9927)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries now support the decimal format returned by `cluster_logical_timestamp()` for maximum precision. [#9934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9934)
- The `CASCADE` option of [`DROP TABLE`](../v1.0/drop-table.html) and [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) now drops views that depend on the table or column; it is now an error to attempt to drop a table or column with dependent views without either using this option or dropping the views first. [#9724](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9724), [#10124](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10124)
- `SET DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` is now supported, improving compatibility with `psycopg2`. [#10087](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10087)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_indexes` and `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` tables are now supported. [#9869](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9869), [#9991](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9991)
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) can now be used with `SHOW`, `HELP`, and `ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT`. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)
- The `current_schemas()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) is now supported, improving compatibility with ActiveRecord. [#9604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9604)
- The [`SHOW ALL`](../v1.0/show-vars.html) statement is now supported. [#10195](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10195)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The `--host` flag in [client commands](../v1.0/cockroach-commands.html) such as [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now defaults to `localhost` in both secure and insecure modes. [#10134](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10134)
- Improved error messages when a server is down or certificates are not configured correctly. [#9917](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9917)
- The `--key` flag can now be passed via the [environment variable](../v1.0/cockroach-commands.html#environment-variables) `COCKROACH_KEY`, matching other similar flags. [#10092](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10092)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- RocksDB bloom filters now use 10x less memory, with a negligible reduction in speed. [#10085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10085)

- Reduced overhead of the internal time-series metric system. [#9889](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9889)
- Reduced impact of schema changes on regular queries. [#9798](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9798)
- In the event of a node failure, schema changes now save their progress and can resume from their last checkpoint instead of restarting from the beginning. [#10036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10036)
- Ranges are now split more eagerly when tables are created or data is growing rapidly. [#10232](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10232)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Certain network- and timeout-related errors will now return the error "transaction commit result is ambiguous" when it cannot be determined whether a transaction committed or not. This fixes bugs in which statements outside of transactions could be applied twice, and other transactions may incorrectly report unique constraint violations. [#10207](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10207)
- [`SET TIME ZONE 0`](../v1.0/set-vars.html#set-time-zone) now sets the session time zone to UTC (other numbers already worked). [#9992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9992)
- `SHOW` statements for session variables now work correctly when prepared and executed separately. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)
- Columns that are a part of the primary key can now be renamed. [#10018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10018)

- Float comparisons involving `NaN` are now correct in all cases. [#10112](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10112)
- Clock offset monitoring is now more sensitive. [#10185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10185)
- The rebalancer is now better able to avoid placing a replica on a store that has previously had a corrupted replica of the same range. [#10141](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10141)
- More complex expressions involving window functions are now supported. [#10186](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10186)
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when using the Prometheus metrics endpoint. [#10228](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10228)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Users (other than `root`) must now be created with the `CREATE USER` statement or `cockroach user set` command before they can be used for TLS certificate- or password-based authentication.  [#9794](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9794)
- The `ambiguous result` error message introduced in `beta-20161027` is now simply `result is ambiguous` since it may be returned outside of transactions. [#10279](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10279)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Password-based authentication is now supported. Clients can authenticate with either a TLS certificate or a password. Documentation coming soon.[#9794](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9794)
- The `SHOW USERS` statement is now supported. [#10088](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10088)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_type`, `pg_catalog.pg_database`, `pg_catalog.pg_views`, `pg_catalog.pg_proc`, and `pg_catalog.pg_am` tables are now supported. [#10209](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10209), [#10284](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10284), [#10276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10276), [#10217](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10217), [#10363](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10363)
- The `information_schema.statistics` and `information_schema.views` tables are now supported. [#10220](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10220), [#10288](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10288)
- [`SHOW TABLES`](../v1.0/show-tables.html) now adds a `(dropped)` suffix to tables that are being dropped. [#10063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10063)
- [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](../v1.0/show-create-view.html) now only requires permissions on the view, not the underlying tables. [#10270](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10270)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- When entering a transaction in the [built-in sql shell](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html), the statements are not sent to the server until there is either a `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, or two blank lines. This minimizes the lifetime of the transaction and therefore the risk of conflicts. [#10187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10187)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Queries that span multiple ranges are now executed across those ranges in parallel. [#9197](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9197)
- Time series data (used in the admin UI) is now loaded in parallel. [#10250](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10250)
- Rebalancing now reaches an equilibrium faster. [#10330](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10330)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Memory usage of SQL queries is now monitored, and queries that use too much will fail rather than exhaust the server's memory. [#9259](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9259)
- Fixed a problem with snapshot error handling that could cause the cluster to be unable to make progress after node failure.
- Computing the `log()` of a very large number no longer causes the server to hang. [#10221](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10221)
- Decimal numbers are now parsed correctly in `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries. [#10242](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10242)
- `concat_ws()` with no arguments no longer crashes the server. [#10309](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10309)
- Fixed a bug when a command was executed after its client had disconnected. [#10279](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10279)

<h3 id="beta-20161103-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Clarified and expanded the [`transactions`](../v1.0/transactions.html) overview documentation, and completed docs on transaction-specific statements: [#672](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/672)
    - [`BEGIN`](../v1.0/begin-transaction.html)

    - [`SHOW`](../v1.0/show-vars.html)
- Added language-specific examples for [`INSERT` statements with `RETURNING`](../v1.0/insert.html#insert-and-return-values). [#813](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/813)
- Updated the [SQL Feature Support](../v1.0/sql-feature-support.html) page to reflect support for [views](../v1.0/views.html) (SQL standard) and [interleaved tables](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) (CockroachDB extensions).

<h3 id="beta-20161201-upgrade-notes">Upgrade Notes</h3>

Due to changes in the on-disk format of internal range leases, this release cannot be run concurrently with any prior release. All servers running older versions must be stopped before starting any node with this version. [#10420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10420)

We realize that "stop the world" upgrades are overly interruptive and are actively working on infrastructure improvements to drastically reduce the need for such upgrades in the future.

<h3 id="beta-20161201-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now *vendors* its dependencies, so building from source no longer interferes with other project in the `$GOPATH`. [#9900](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9900)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Adding a [`FOREIGN KEY`](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) constraint now automatically creates necessary indexes. [#9572](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9572)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_roles`, `pg_catalog.pg_description`, `pg_catalog.pg_settings`, and `pg_catalog.pg_index` tables are now supported. [#10377](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10377) [#10381](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10381) [#10293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10293) [#10548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10548) [#10592](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10592)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_depend` table is now partially supported (just enough to support `pgjdbc`). [#10696](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10696)
- `pg_catalog` tables now report databases as belonging to PostgreSQL-compatible namespaces. This is for compatibility only; CockroachDB does not have a notion of namespaces. [#11603](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11603)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_get_expr` and `pg_catalog.pg_generate_series` functions are now supported. [#10952](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10952) [#11214](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11214)
- The `conkey` and `confkey` columns of the `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` table now return real integer arrays. [#10584](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10584)
- New [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) `from_ip()` and `to_ip()` convert between binary and textual IP address formats. [#10349](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10349)
- Tuple types can now be returned by queries. [#10380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10380)
- The SQL standard interval format `Y-M-D` is now supported. [#10499](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10499)
- The `array_length`, `array_upper`, and `array_lower` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are now available. [#10565](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10565)

- The `pow()` and `div()` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now work when both arguments are integers. [#10538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10538)
- The `ARRAY[]` constructor syntax is now supported. [#10585](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10585)

- The [`CREATE DATABASE`](../v1.0/create-database.html) statement now accepts the options `TEMPLATE`, `LC_COLLATE`, and `LC_CTYPE` for compatibility with PostgreSQL, although the values available for these options are limited. [#10775](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10775)
- The [`SELECT`](../v1.0/select.html) statement now supports the `WITH ORDINALITY` modifier to generate row numbers. [#10558](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10558)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- Temporary directories are no longer created automatically for logging. Commands other than `cockroach start` log to `stderr` if no `--log-dir` flag is given, and `cockroach start` writes to the directory of the first store. Various combinations of `--log-dir`, `--logtostderr`, and `--alsologtostderr` now work in more sensible ways. [#10675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10675) [#10926](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10926) [#10962](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10962)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) prompt now indicates the status of the current transaction (if any). [#10866](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10866)
- The `--password` flag for the [`cockroach user set`](../v1.0/create-and-manage-users.html) command no longer accepts the new password as a command-line argument; instead this flag is a boolean to determine whether a password should be created for the user. The password is always read from `stdin`. [#10680](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10680)
- The [`cockroach user set`](../v1.0/create-and-manage-users.html) command no longer prompts for passwords in insecure mode unless `--password` is given. [#10547](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10547)
- The `cockroach debug compact` command now always rewrites all data, allowing it to pick up configuration changes. [#10532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10532)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- The design of the Database tab has been updated. [#10552](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10552)
- Syntax highlighting is now used when displaying `CREATE TABLE` statements. [#10579](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10579)
- The UI no longer attempts to display information about the virtual databases `information_schema` and `pg_catalog`. [#10920](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10920)
- Metrics for the fraction of available and fully-replicated ranges are now computed more accurately. [#11213](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11213)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Reduced memory allocations when encoding dates and times. [#10531](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10531)
- Parsing hexadecimal literals using the `x''` syntax is now more efficient. [#10660](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10660)
- Time series pruning is now more efficient. [#10682](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10682)
- Commands that have been canceled by clients no longer accumulate in the internal command queue. [#10772](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10772)
- When a command that has been retried on multiple replicas succeeds on any of them, any in-flight attempts on the other replicas is canceled. [#10970](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10970)
- The fast-path for local "RPCs" now uses goroutines to avoid blocking the caller. [#11196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11196)

- Most write statements now accept a `RETURNING NOTHING` clause to indicate that the query should not return a result (not even the number of rows affected). This will be used in the future to enable optimizations. [#13802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13802)
- PostgreSQL-style duration formats are now parsed case-insensitively. [#13748](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13748)
- Tables with no columns are now handled correctly in the network protocol. [#13765](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13765)
- `COPY` no longer requires the input data to end in a newline. [#13858](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13858)
- [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](../v1.0/show-constraints.html) no longer includes constraints involving hidden columns. [#13870](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13870)
- It is no longer possible to drop system tables. [#13911](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13911)
- The `DESC` modifier can now be applied to columns in a [`PRIMARY KEY`](../v1.0/primary-key.html) or [`UNIQUE`](../v1.0/unique.html) clause during table creation. [#13924](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13924)

<h3 id="beta-20170309-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach dump`](../v1.0/sql-dump.html) command now takes an `--as-of` flag, which can be used to make a backup as of a particular time.
- When [starting a node](../v1.0/start-a-node.html), the details printed to `stdout` are now written to the node's `INFO` log as well. Also, these details now include node attributes and locality. [#1143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1143), [#1144](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1144)

<h3 id="beta-20170309-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed (again) a bug in error handling that could causes ranges to get stuck if an error occurred during a rebalance. [#13763](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13763)
- Work around a bug that could cause GRPC connections to get stuck in a broken state. [#13822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13822)

<h3 id="beta-20170309-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Improved performance in high-contention scenarios by introducing a queue to wait for conflicting transactions to finish. This also reduces the likelihood of transaction restarts due to write/write conflicts. [#13501](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13501)
- A new lease implementation is now used for most ranges, reducing the number of writes that must be done just to maintain a lease. [#13826](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13826)
- Reduced the occurrence of `AmbiguousResultError` by waiting for pending RPCs to complete before returning. [#13800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13800)
- Changed some mutexes to `RWMutexes`. Removed some instrumentation of mutex timing. [#13697](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13697)
- `cockroach dump` now works in larger batches. [#13812](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13812)
- Failed snapshots no longer disrupt regular raft messages. [#13816](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13816)
- Increased flow control parameters for GRPC connections, improving performance on high-latency links. [#13840](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13840)
- Increased limits on in-flight raft messages. [#13862](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13862)
- Range leases are now proactively transferred away from draining nodes. [#13792](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13792)
- Avoid sending redundant PushTxn calls in intent resolution. [#13955](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13955)

<h3 id="beta-20170309-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Added an FAQ on [auto-generating unique IDs in CockroachDB](../v1.0/sql-faqs.html#how-do-i-auto-generate-unique-row-ids-in-cockroachdb). [#1126](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1126)
- Expanded guidance on [using a SQL table as an alternative to direct key-value access](../v1.0/frequently-asked-questions.html#can-i-use-cockroachdb-as-a-key-value-store). [#1122](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1122)
- Added details about [using the `BIT` type to constrain integers](../v1.0/int.html#size) based on their corresponding binary values. [#1116](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1116)
- Added details about [building a binary](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html) that excludes enterprise functionality covered by the CockroachDB Community License (CCL). [#1130](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1130)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- The implementation of indexing for [collated string columns](../v1.0/collate.html) has changed. Any secondary indexes containing collated strings must be [dropped](../v1.0/drop-index.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-created](../v1.0/create-index.html) after upgrading. Note that this applies only to secondary indexes, not to primary indexes. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- Any row with a `-0` [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) or [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) value in a primary key or index must be [deleted](../v1.0/delete.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-inserted](../v1.0/insert.html) after upgrading. Otherwise, the row containing `-0` will show up during table scans, but it will not be possible to delete it or select it as part of an index scan.

  If you suspect `-0` values are present but do not know where, an alternative approach is to use [`cockroach dump`](../v1.0/sql-dump.html) to back up tables with `FLOAT` or `DECIMAL` columns, drop the tables before upgrading, and then use the backup files to recreate the tables and indexes after upgrading. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- The `experimental_strptime` and `experimental_strftime` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are currently using these functions, please let us know [here](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/t/are-you-using-experimental-strptime-or-experimental-strftime/545).

- Several undocumented environment variables have been removed. [#14786](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14786) [#14797](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14797)
- Clusters which have used the `COCKROACH_PROPOSER_EVALUATED_KV` environment variable require special care when upgrading to this release; contact us for more information. [#14773](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14773)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- Building CockroachDB from source no longer uses `$GOPATH/bin` for anything except the final binary produced by `make install`. [#14629](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14629)
- Developers should use `make generate` instead of `go generate` to ensure the correct tool versions are used. [#14672](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14672)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- SQL variables can now be reset to their default values with the `RESET` statement or `SET x TO DEFAULT`. [#14105](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14105)
- Schema changes within [transactions](../v1.0/transactions.html) are now restricted. Certain combinations of schema changes with other statements (which would previously hang) will now return an error. It is recommended that DDL statements be issued outside of transactions, or as the only statement within a transaction. [#14368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14368)
- Subqueries are now supported as the source of `UPDATE` statements. [#14611](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14611)
- Timestamp parsing now understands the format used by JDBC's `setTimestamp`. [#14712](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14712)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html) values larger than a month now use the suffix `mon` instead of `m` (which is also used for minutes). Intervals can now be parsed from strings containing decimals and negative numbers. [#14534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14534)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html) values now support multiplication and division by [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) values. [#14614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14614)
- Arithmetic operations on integers now check for overflow. [#14682](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14682)
- Comparisons involving tuples with non-identical types are now allowed whenever the comparison of the individual elements would be allowed. [#14674](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14674)
- The implementation of the `experimental_strptime` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) is now consistent across platforms. [#14801](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14801)
- `BETWEEN` now supports any combination of types that would be supported by individual comparison operators. [#14754](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14754)
- Handling of untyped literals during overload resolution is now more consistent. [#14593](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14593)
- [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](../v1.0/rollback-transaction.html) is now allowed at any time, not only after receiving a "retry transaction" error. [#14538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14538)
- [`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`](../v1.0/create-table-as.html) now returns the number of rows affected to the SQL client driver. [#13187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13187)
- [`ALTER TABLE .. ADD CONSTRAINT`](../v1.0/add-constraint.html) can now be used to add a self-referential foreign key. [#14711](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14711)
- The `RETURNING NOTHING` clause can now be used outside of a transaction, although it does not provide any performance benefit in this case. [#14551](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14551)
- [SQL user names](../v1.0/create-user.html) are now required to start with a letter, contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, and be no longer than 63 characters. [#14525](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14525)
- The [`BYTES`](../v1.0/bytes.html) type name is now reported as `bytea` in `pg_catalog.pg_type` for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#14495](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14495)
- The PostgreSQL type IO functions (like `int8in`, `int8out`, `int8send`, and `int8recv`) have placeholder implementations for compatibility with some ORMs. [#14529](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14529)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command now recognizes the special zone names `.meta`, `.timeseries`, and `.system` to set configurations for system metadata. [#14740](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14740)
- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command no longer uses the `COCKROACH_PORT` environment variable; the port must be set on the server's command line (similar to `--host` and other flags). [#14612](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14612)
- The [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) command is now more robust. [#14775](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14775)
- Command history no longer corrupts previous commands when normalizing them. [#14496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14496)
- Commands entered as a single line are now saved together in the history. [#14846](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14846)
- The config file generated by [`cockroach gen haproxy`](../v1.0/generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) now enables health checks for the server. [#14624](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14624)
- The `--store` and `--log-dir` flags now reject arguments starting with `~` that were not expanded by the shell. [#14746](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14746)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- The **Node List** page has been improved. [#14395](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14395)
- A new `node-id` metric with labels for the node's address is now exported for use in external monitoring systems. [#14544](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14544)
- The `/debug/` pages are now accessible only from `localhost` by default. Set the environment variable `COCKROACH_REMOTE_DEBUG=any` when running the server to allow remote access. [#14647](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14647) [#14675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14675)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- A new, more efficient format is now used for indexes with the [`STORING`](../v1.0/create-index.html#store-columns) clause. Existing indexes will still work, but will need to be dropped and recreated to get the benefits of the new format. [#14758](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14758)
- A single `TimestampCache` is now shared by all replicas on a store, providing better control over memory usage and better support for large transactions. [#14489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14489)
- Reduced memory used by the `TimestampCache`. [#14516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14516) [#14514](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14514)
- Replica garbage collection is now much more efficient. [#14391](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14391)
- [Adding](../v1.0/add-column.html) and [dropping](../v1.0/drop-column.html) columns now uses the distributed SQL engine. [#14331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14331)
- The health of inter-node connections is now monitored using HTTP/2 ping frames instead of regular RPCs. This ensures that HTTP flow control cannot cause a connection to be considered unhealthy. [#14424](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14424)
- The limit on the number of concurrent inter-node RPCs has been increased. [#14785](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14785)
- The bandwidth used by range snapshots is now limited to 2MB/sec by default to reduce impact on live traffic. [#14718](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14718)
- If a single row grows larger than the configured maximum range size, the split queue will no longer spin trying to split the range repeatedly. [#14654](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14654)
- Several kinds of tracing and logging have been disabled by default. [#14677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14677)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed an issue with [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) and [`DELETE`](../v1.0/delete.html) on tables with [`STORING`](../v1.0/create-index.html#store-columns) indexes. Indexes affected by this bug will need to be dropped and recreated. [#14643](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14643)
- `BETWEEN` now handles `NULL` in the same way as other comparison operators. [#14686](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14686)
- Fixed a bug with comparisons involving division with a constant negative divisor. [#14702](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14702)
- [`INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html#update-values-on-conflict) no longer uses an error-prone optimization. The [`UPSERT`](../v1.0/upsert.html) statement is now faster than the equivalent `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement. [#14485](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14485)
- Schema changes now abort more reliably when encountering errors. [#14025](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14025)
- Joining nodes of two different clusters is now detected more reliably. [#14475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14475)
- Fixed a panic during prepared [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements. [#14481](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14481)
- [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) and [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes now consider `0` and `-0` equal (although the sign will correctly be retained). [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)
- [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes no longer have zeros truncated. If a secondary index contains a `DECIMAL` value with trailing zeros, you can [drop](../v1.0/drop-index.html) and [re-create](../v1.0/create-index.html) the index to have the value returned correctly when the index is used. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)
- Fixed a crash when assigning with the `DEFAULT` keyword in [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements. [#14640](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14640)

<h3 id="beta-20170413-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Updated the [Start a Local Cluster](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster.html) tutorial to better highlight core CockroachDB capabilities such as automated replications and fault tolerance. [#1257](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1257)
- Expanded the [Build a Ruby App with CockroachDB](../v1.0/build-a-ruby-app-with-cockroachdb-activerecord.html) tutorial to feature the ActiveRecord ORM. [#1234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1234)
- Clarified the `--store` flag in the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) documentation. [#1243](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1243)
- Updated the [build from source](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html) instructions to use a source tarball instead of the `cockroach` GitHub repository. The source tarball downloads faster and doesn't need to be extracted in the `GOPATH`. Developers who want to contribute to CockroachDB should use the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) instead. [#1209](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1209)
- Added Google Cloud Spanner to the [CockroachDB in Comparison](../v1.0/cockroachdb-in-comparison.html) chart. [#1264](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1264)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Security-related command-line arguments have been changed. Instead of using multiple flags, certificates and keys are now loaded from a single [`--certs-dir`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html#certificate-directory) flag, which defaults to `~/.cockroach-certs` but can be set to a custom location. The individual flags still work in this release but will be removed in the next one. Also note that the `--insecure` flag is now **required** for insecure mode. [#14703](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14703)
- The `--alsologtostderr` argument has been renamed to `--logtostderr`, and now takes an optional argument to specify a threshold. [#14841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14841)
- The `^` operator now means `pow()` instead of bitwise xor (bitwise xor uses the `#` operator; this is consistent with PostgreSQL). Any tables with this operator in a [`DEFAULT`](../v1.0/default-value.html) or [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) expression will need to be updated. [#14882](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14882)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-upgrade-notes">Upgrade Notes</h3>

- This release cannot run at the same time as releases prior to [`beta-20170413`](beta-20170413.html). If you are running an older version, you must either upgrade to that version first or take down all servers in the cluster before starting any server with this version. This release includes new functionality to make future upgrades smoother. [#14959](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14959)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- CockroachDB's build system has been rewritten to improve portability. It can no longer be installed with `go get` alone; use of the `Makefile` is now required. GNU Make, CMake, and XZ Utils must also be installed to build from source. As a result, CockroachDB can now be built on a larger variety of systems. [#14840](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14840)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Type errors in [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints are now detected earlier. [#14984](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14984)
- Aggregation functions now work correctly above the windowing level. [#14729](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14729)
- The default precision for inexact decimal operations is now 20 digits (up from 16). [#15001](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15001)
- Bounds are now checked when converting [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) or [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values to [`INTEGER`](../v1.0/int.html). [#14967](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14967)
- The `pg_catalog` data for `int2vector` is now consistent with PostgreSQL. [#14989](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14989)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach cert`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html) commands have been updated to reflect the new `--certs-dir` convention. [#14703](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14703)
- New flags `--log-file-max-size` (default 10 MiB) and `--log-dir-max-size` (default 100 MiB) can be used to control log rotation and deletion. The `--log-file-verbosity` flag (default `INFO`) can be used to control the verbosity of the log file. [#14841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14841)
- Critical errors are now written to `stderr` regardless of the logging configuration. [#14926](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14926) [#15025](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15025) [#15040](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15040)
- The server will now reload its certificates and keys on a `SIGHUP`. [#14925](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14925)
- Some commands which previously required a `node` certificate now work with the `root` client certificate. [#14972](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14972)
- The undocumented `cockroach debug kv` commands have been removed. [#14857](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14857)
- The [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) command now has a hard timeout of 1 minute if the cluster has lost quorum. [#14708](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14708)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- Improved alert banners. [#14915](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14915) [#15010](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15010)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Transactions no longer get stuck forever when a split occurs while they are waiting for a conflicting transaction. [#14974](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14974)
- The Admin UI can now display tables with non-lowercase names. [#14818](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14818)
- Fixed a panic with "span and descriptor's range do not overlap". [#14952](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14952)
- Fixed a data race in the Prometheus exporter. [#14943](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14943)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- The timestamp cache is now much more efficient, leading to a 42% speedup on single-node write-only benchmarks. [#14867](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14867)
- Transaction deadlocks are now detected faster. [#14789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14789)
- Fixed a memory "leak" in Raft. [#15041](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15041)
- Improved performance of concurrent RPCs on a single GRPC connection. [#14939](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14939)
- Raft processing now uses more threads. [#14897](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14897)
- Improved performance of schema changes that add indexes. [#14937](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14937)
- Reduced the number of cgo calls for RocksDB iterators. [#14920](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14920)

<h3 id="beta-20170420-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- It is not possible to upgrade directly to this version of CockroachDB from a version older than [`beta-20170413`](beta-20170413.html). Upgrade any older clusters to that version first. [#15228](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15228)
- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command no longer recognizes the `COCKROACH_INSECURE` and `COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR` environment variables which are intended to be client-only. Use the `--insecure` and `--certs-dir` command-line flags instead. [#15196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15196) [#15288](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15288)
- Older certificate-related command-line flags have been removed; use `--certs-dir` instead. [#15241](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15241)
- Various environment variables have been removed in favor of the new `CLUSTER SETTING` commands described below.
- The undocumented `SET SYNTAX` statement and the "modern" syntax variant have been removed. [#15064](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15064)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- [Anonymous diagnostics statistics](../v1.0/diagnostics-reporting.html) are now reported by default. To opt out, set `COCKROACH_SKIP_ENABLING_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORTING=true` in the environment when starting the cluster, or use `SET CLUSTER SETTING diagnostics.reporting.enabled = false` in the SQL shell on clusters already running. [#14901](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14901)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now builds on Windows. Windows support is currently experimental and is recommended only for development, not production.
- Building from source on macOS 10.11 works again. [#15168](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15168)
- Building from source on older CPUs (without SSE4.2) works again. [#15247](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15247)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-enterprise-features">Enterprise Features</h3>

- Distributed backup and restore capabilities are now available to [enterprise-license customers](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/cockroachdb-community-license/). Using the new [`BACKUP`](../v1.0/backup.html) SQL statement, a cluster's schema and data can be backed up in full or incrementally as of a given timestamp, and can be stored on the platforms you're already using, including AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, NFS, or HTTP storage. In the unlikely event of irreparable cluster failure, the new [`RESTORE`](../v1.0/restore.html) SQL statement can be used to restore a cluster from enterprise backups. Importantly, backup and restore operations are distributed across the nodes of a cluster, minimizing the impact on cluster performance.

  For details about pricing, [contact Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/).

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Table names and other identifiers are now case-insensitive in all cases, even when used in double quotes. These identifiers will be shown in lowercase in many introspection interfaces. This is consistent with PostgreSQL and improves compatibility with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. [#15434](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15434)
- New `SHOW ALL CLUSTER SETTINGS` and `SET CLUSTER SETTING` statements can be used to view and change certain [cluster-wide settings](../v1.0/cluster-settings.html). The following cluster settings are available in this release:
  - `diagnostics.reporting.enabled`
  - `diagnostics.reporting.report_metrics`
  - `diagnostics.reporting.send_crash_reports`
  - `kv.allocator.lease_rebalancing_aggressiveness`
  - `kv.allocator.load_based_lease_rebalancing.enabled`
  - `kv.raft.command.max_size`
  - `kv.raft_log.synchronize`
  - `kv.snapshot_rebalance.max_rate`
  - `kv.snapshot_recovery.max_rate`
  - `kv.transaction.max_intents`
  - `server.remote_debugging.mode`
  - `sql.defaults.distsql`
  - `sql.metrics.statement_details.dump_to_logs`
  - `sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled`
  - `sql.metrics.statement_details.threshold`
  - `sql.trace.log_statement_execute`
  - `sql.trace.session_eventlog.enabled`
  - `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold`
- The `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` statements can now be used to use prepared statements in a SQL shell. [#15256](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15256)
- The `regexp_replace()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now handles newlines correctly, both with and without the `n` flag. [#15309](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15309)
- Precedence for the binary `~` [operator](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#operators) (regex match) has been changed. This could cause [`DEFAULT`](../v1.0/default-value.html) or [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) expressions to have different behavior if `~` was used in combination with other operators. These will need to be fixed manually. [#15264](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15264)
- Ambiguous results now return the PostgreSQL "statement completion unknown" error code. [#15054](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15054)
- Time zones can now be specified in more formats in [`DATE`](../v1.0/date.html) types, including `+0700`, `+07`, `+7`, and `+07:00`. [#15177](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15177)
- Set-returning [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) (like `generate_series()`) are now supported in more contexts. [#14369](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14369)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- Tooltips are now shown on graphs. [#15282](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15282)
- Fixed elements that overlapped incorrectly. [#15387](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15387)
- Improved handling of long strings in table cells. [#15387](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15387)
- The SQL statement latency graphs now include some overhead that was not previously accounted for. [#15176](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15176)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The default lifetime of certificates generated by [`cockroach cert`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html) has been increased to 10 years. [#15306](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15306)
- The output format of [`cockroach cert list`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html) has been improved. [#15198](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15198)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Table scans over [interleaved tables](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) now work correctly. [#15043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15043)
- Fixed backslash escaping when used with the Python `psycopg2` driver. [#15281](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15281)
- Improved certificate validation, fixing compatibility with client certs as used by `psql`. [#15286](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15286)
- Fixed a race between lease transfers and repair/rebalance operations. [#15355](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15355)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- A new distributed SQL execution engine is now used for a large subset of [`SELECT`](../v1.0/select.html) statements. Instead of returning all table data involved in the query to the gateway node for final computations, computation is distributed between the gateway node and the nodes where the data resides, with just the relevant results returned to the gateway node. This deeper distribution of work significantly improves performance of queries, especially those using [aggregation functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) or [joins](../v1.0/table-expressions.html#join-expressions).
- Smoothed out request stats used by lease rebalancing and reduced thrashing. [#15156](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15156) [#15321](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15321)
- Improved retry logic after lease failures. [#15199](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15199)
- Snapshots that are necessary for recovery are now given higher recovery than those used for rebalancing. [#15279](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15279)
- Very large transactions and commands that might cause the server to run out of memory are now rejected earlier. [#15350](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15350)
- Node liveness heartbeats are now retried when they fail due to heavy load. [#15362](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15362)
- Improved priority adjustments when transactions are pushed. [#7380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7380)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.1-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Expanded documentation on [backing up](../v1.0/back-up-data.html) and [restoring data](../v1.0/restore-data.html) to cover both distributed capabilities covered by our enterprise license as well as non-distributed dump and import functionality. [#1239](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1239)
- Added [SQL-specific FAQs](../v1.0/sql-faqs.html). [#1315](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1315)
- Documented the [order in which operators are evaluated](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#operators) within statements. [#1322](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1322)
- Documented the known list of [differences between PostgreSQL and CockroachDB](../v1.0/porting-postgres.html) for identical SQL input, with porting instructions. [#1328](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1328)
- Expanded best practices when [using the `--locality` setting](../v1.0/recommended-production-settings.html) to replicate evenly across datacenters. [#1334](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1334)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- [Diagnostics reporting](../v1.0/diagnostics-reporting.html) now includes anonymized query statistics. [#15491](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15491)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Restrictions on schema changes in transactions with other statements have been relaxed. It is now possible to insert into a table in the same transaction that created it, provided there are no [`FOREIGN KEY`](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) or [`INTERLEAVE`](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) clauses. [#15511](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15511)
- The distributed SQL engine supports queries that internally generate rows with no columns. [#15420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15420)
- New variables added to the [cluster-wide settings](../v1.0/cluster-settings.html): `server.declined_reservation_timeout`, `server.failed_reservation_timeout`, and `server.time_until_store_dead`. [#15581](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15581)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- If the new flag `--listening-url-file` is passed to [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html), the server will write its SQL connection URL to the specified file on successful startup, in addition to printing it to `stdout`. This is particularly helpful in identifying the node's port when an unused port is assigned automatically (`--port=0`).[#15468](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15468)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell no longer buffers all results in memory before printing them. [#15277](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15277)
- The log file is now flushed more reliably when a node exits. [#15531](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15531)
- The new flag `--max-offset` on the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command defines the maximum allowed clock offset for the cluster and replaces the environment variable `COCKROACH_MAX_OFFSET`. Note that the `--max-offset` value must be the same on all nodes in the cluster. In order to change it, every node in the cluster must be stopped and restarted with the new value. [#15568](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15568)
- The `--raft-tick-interval` flag has been removed from the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command. [#15547](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15547)
- Certificate and key loading errors during node startup are now reported to the user via `stdout` as well as being written to the log file. [#15655](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15655)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- The number of transactions that would be affected by a change in isolation level is now tracked. [#15234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15234)
- Improved style of the single node and log pages. [#15486](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15486)
- The event log now refreshes automatically. [#15502](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15502)
- Graphs on the overview page now have tooltips. [#15624](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15624)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed a panic when a query returning a constant `NULL` uses the new distributed execution engine. [#15530](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15530)

- Fixed a rare crash when extending table leases. [#15560](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15560)
- Fixed a crash when a transaction that uses [`SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v1.0/savepoint.html) does something other than `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` after an error. [#15563](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15563)
- Fixed [`RESTORE`](../v1.0/restore.html) for interleaved tables. [#15564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15564)
- Return parse error instead of panic when constant typechecking fails. [#15636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15636)
- Prevent persistent distsql and schema change errors after a node dies. [#15368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15368)
- Previously, [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v1.0/add-column.html) with a `DEFAULT unique_rowid()` specification could create many duplicate values. This has been corrected. [#15628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15628)
- Fixed a consistency error in [`BACKUP`](../v1.0/backup.html). [#15642](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15642)
- Fixed incorrect NULL results when using an aggregation with an empty table. [#15688](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15688)

- Reduced thrashing in gossip after a rolling restart. [#15533](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15533)
- [`RESTORE`](../v1.0/restore.html) performs its pre-splitting less aggressively. [#15548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15548)
- Improved memory accounting in distributed SQL. [#15595](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15595), [#15610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15610), [#15623](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15623), [#15627](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15627)
- Queries using session-dependent variables (e.g., time conversions using the session's timezone) are now executed through the distributed SQL engine. [#15628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15628)

<h3 id="v1.0-rc.2-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Added an FAQ on different [ways to log SQL queries](../v1.0/sql-faqs.html). [#1359](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1359)
- Updated [local deployment tutorials](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster.html) to have nodes listen only on `localhost`. This ensures these tutorials work even on machines whose hostnames aren’t resolvable. [#1358](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1358)
